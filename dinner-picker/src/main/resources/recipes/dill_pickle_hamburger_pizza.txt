Ingredients
- 1/2 pound ground beef
- 1 prebaked 12-inch pizza crust
- 1/2 cup ketchup
- 1/4 cup prepared mustard
- 1-1/2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
- 2 cups shredded lettuce
- 1/2 cup chopped dill pickle
- 1/4 cup chopped onion
- 1/2 cup mayonnaise
- 2 to 3 tablespoons dill pickle juice

Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425Â°. In a large skillet, cook beef over medium heat until no longer pink, 3-4 minutes, breaking it into crumbles; drain.
2. Meanwhile, place crust on an ungreased baking sheet or pizza pan. Mix ketchup and mustard; spread over crust. Add ground beef; bake 5 minutes. Sprinkle with cheese; bake until cheese is bubbly and crust is lightly browned, 8-10 minutes longer.
3. Top with lettuce, pickle and onion. Whisk mayonnaise and enough pickle juice to reach desired consistency; drizzle over pizza.
