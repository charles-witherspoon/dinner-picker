- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1/2 cup crushed saltines (about 10 crackers)
- 1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper

1. Mix first 4 ingredients and nutmeg if desired. Add beef and sausage; mix lightly but thoroughly. Shape into 1-in. balls; toss with 1/4 cup flour, coating lightly.
2. In a large skillet, brown meatballs over medium-high heat. Add 2 cups broth; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, until meatballs are cooked through, 5-6 minutes.
