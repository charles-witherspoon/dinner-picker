Ingredients
- 2 tablespoons butter, melted
- 1 cup crushed cornflakes
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1-1/2 teaspoons seasoned salt
- 3/4 cup egg substitute
- 4 chicken drumsticks (4 ounces each), skin removed
- 4 bone-in chicken thighs (about 1-1/2 pounds), skin removed

Directions
1. Preheat oven to 425°. Drizzle butter in a 13x9-in. baking dish. In a shallow bowl, combine the cornflakes, flour and seasoned salt. Place egg substitute in another shallow bowl. Dip chicken in egg substitute, then roll in cornflake mixture. Repeat.
2. Arrange chicken in prepared dish, meatier side down. Bake, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Turn chicken over; bake until a thermometer reads 170°-175°, 10-15 minutes longer.

Tips
Q: How do you prevent cornflake chicken from drying out?
A: Honestly, this recipe is pretty hard to get wrong—just be careful not to overcook the chicken! Bone-in chicken pieces are naturally more juicy than boneless cuts, and that’s why they’re well represented in our best chicken recipes. Each one of these bone-in chicken thigh recipes is just as juicy, too.
Q: What is the best type of chicken to use for this cornflake chicken recipe?
A: This recipe calls for drumsticks and thighs, but you could also prepare this recipe with cut-up whole chickens that include breast meat and wings (although you’ll have to adjust the bake time for the larger and smaller pieces). If you’re using a whole cut-up chicken, be sure to reach for a broiler/fryer chicken, which is smaller and more tender than a larger chicken. Brush up on your chicken label lingo and the best chicken to buy for different recipes.
Q: Are there any substitutions you can make in this cornflake chicken recipe?
A: If you don’t want to use egg substitute, you can use three whole eggs instead (although keep in mind, it will increase the calories, fat and cholesterol). You can also use bone-in pork chops instead of the chicken.
