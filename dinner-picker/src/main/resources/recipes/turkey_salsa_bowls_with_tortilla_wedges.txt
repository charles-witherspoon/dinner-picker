Ingredients
- 1 pound lean ground turkey
- 1/2 cup chopped sweet pepper
- 1/4 cup thinly sliced celery
- 2 green onions, chopped
- 1 jar (16 ounces) medium salsa
- 1 can (16 ounces) kidney beans, rinsed and drained
- 1 cup uncooked instant brown rice
- 1 cup water
- 4 whole wheat tortillas (8 inches)
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 8 cups torn romaine (about 1 head)
- Optional toppings: Chopped tomatoes, sliced ripe olives, cubed avocado, shredded cheddar cheese and chopped green onions

Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400Â°. In a large skillet, cook and crumble turkey with pepper, celery and green onions over medium-high heat until no longer pink, 5-7 minutes. Stir in salsa, beans, rice and water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, covered, until liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes.
2. Brush both sides of tortillas with oil; cut each into 8 wedges. Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake until lightly browned, 8-10 minutes.
3. To serve, divide lettuce among 8 bowls; top with turkey mixture. Serve with tortilla wedges; add toppings as desired.
